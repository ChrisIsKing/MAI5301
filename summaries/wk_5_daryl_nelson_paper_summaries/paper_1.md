In the paper FlashAttention by Dao and others focuses on solving a big problem in Transformer models: the attention mechanism is slow and uses a lot of memory, especially for long sequences. Standard self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length, making training and inference both expensive and inefficient. The authors point out that many previous methods try to approximate attention to reduce compute, but these often dont actually run faster in real time because they ignore how slow memory access can be on GPUs. The key idea of the paper is to make the attention algorithm IO-aware by reducing costly data movement between high bandwidth GPU memory and fast on-chip memory.

Methodologically, they introduce a tiling strategy that splits the input into blocks that fit in faster memory, and compute exact attention without materializing the full attention matrix. This dramatically cuts down memory reads and writes, and they also analyze the IO complexity showing that this approach needs far fewer high bandwidth memory accesses than standard attention. The paper even extends the idea to block-sparse attention, offering a faster approximate variant.

Results are impressive: FlashAttention speeds up training of models like BERT and GPT-2 significantly and lets models handle much longer contexts with better quality, like lower perplexity and improved classification scores. The goals the authors set are clearly met and it feels really relevant, especially as modern large language models rely heavily on efficient attention. Overall, its both a methodological and practical step forward for efficient deep learning
