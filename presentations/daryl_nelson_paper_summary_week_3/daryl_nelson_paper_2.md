Language Models are Few-Shot Learners

This paper looks at a really relevant and ambitious question: can just making language models insanely big actually lead to general-purpose NLP systems that work in zero-shot, one-shot, or few-shot settings. The authors do a good job of placing their work in the context of previous research on large models and multi-task learning, and they explain pretty clearly why they wanted to try a 175-billion parameter model. The paper is mostly well-organized too, walking the reader through the model design, training setup, and evaluation in a way that’s easy to follow, and then showing results across a bunch of different tasks, from commonsense reasoning to reading comprehension and even arithmetic.

That said, there are a few areas that could use more reflection. They show tons of benchmark results, but sometimes it’s not clear why they picked certain prompts, sampling methods, or parameter values, or whether they even tried alternatives. Also, while they report performance on a lot of tasks, there’s not much discussion of failure cases, or examples where the model makes biased or weird outputs. The section on ethics and social bias is a good start, but it feels more like description than actual guidance, and it leaves questions about how one should actually deploy models like this safely.

Another issue is the heavy reliance on English-focused training data, which they mention but don’t really dig into, so it’s hard to know how well the model would work in other languages or domains. And while the scaling results are impressive, it’s not totally clear whether the improvements come from model size, the diversity of data, or training tricks.

Overall, this is really impressive work and shows what massive language models are capable of, but it would be stronger if the authors spent more time explaining key choices, looking at limitations, and reflecting on social impact. I am also curious about comparisons of incontext learning and fine-tuned model performance on downstream tasks
